<p>I love human anatomy and medical history. One of my most favorite places ever the <a href="muttermuseum.org">M&uumltter Museum.</a> which is part of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Some of the many fascinating things you can find there are: </p>

<ul>
<li>The jaw tumor of President Grover Cleveland</li>
<li>One of John Wilke Booth's vertebra</li>
<li>Sections of Einstein's brain</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also many exhibits; some permanent, some special (temporary), and even some online! Here are some of them:</p>

<table border="1">

<h1>Answering Queston #4 in our 2.5 Solo Challenge</h1>
<p>A pertinent site for my subject is the <a href="https://imss.org/">International Museum of Surgical Science.</a></p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Some of the code I recognize is of course, the begining of the basic HTML structure, such as the heading and the title. Another thing that looks familiar is the href= attribute. There are also table elements and lists as you scroll down.</li>
		<li>One of the things that I don't exactly know, but can guess at is lang="en" which specifies the site's language as english. the id="masthead" is also self-explanatory. I'm guessing that < script type= describes the language used in this site.</li>
	</ul>

<p>What makes this <a href="https://imss.org/">site</a> good?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It's easy to navigate</li>		
		<li>There are lots of photos and links</li>
		<li>It's very well organized (e.g. grouping wet specimens together, sorting exhibits by type)</li>
	</ul>
